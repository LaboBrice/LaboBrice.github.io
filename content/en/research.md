# Ecology in the Anthropocene


For more than a century, human activities have largely disrupted the dynamic
equilibrium of natural cycles. Humans have transformed more than 50% of the
earth's surfaces, consume about 40% of the planet's primary productivity each
year and emit so many greenhouse gases that they have altered the global
climate. These global changes transform biodiversity through feedback across the
different levels of organization, from the individual organisms to populations,
communities, ecosystems and biomes.  We are studying these changes in
biodiversity in space and time, particularly in the forests of southern Quebec
and in the urban forests of Montreal.

## Long-term changes in communities

In the absence of pulse disturbances, forest ecosystem response to changes in environmental conditions is controlled by slow long-term processes (recruitment, growth and mortality) and is often time-lagged. To detect changes in ecosystem health, we compare historical and contemporary vegetation surveys. Using  historical data on climate, land use and disturbances, we can identify the causes of these changes. These temporal studies allow to better estimate changes in biodiversity, to quantify how multiple environmental drivers affect the different components of biodiversity and to detect the deterioration of ecosystems and ecosystem services.


## Post-disturbance forest dynamics

Fires, insect outbreaks, windfall, floods are part of the forest natural
dynamics and allow their renewal. Anthropogenic disturbances has altered the
natural disturbance regime by increasing the size, severity and frequency of
disturbances. How do these new disturbances influence the recruitment and
regeneration dynamics? What are their effects on successional trajectories? To
answer these questions, we study forest dynamics and its underlying processes
(tree recruitment, growth and mortality). Understanding the difference between
the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on forest dynamics is
necessary to improve silvicultural practices and to predict future forest
dynamics.

## Urbanization

As the world's population grows and urbanizes and the climate changes, green spaces in cities are not only increasingly threatened but also increasingly essential. It is therefore necessary to understand how cities influence biodiversity and also how biodiversity influences the health and well-being of people. We study the effects of urbanization and management on changes in plant composition and diversity in green spaces. Which species benefit the most from urbanization? What is the relationship between urbanization and ecosystem homogenization? How do these changes in the distribution and abundance of biodiversity influence ecosystem functions and services? By answering these questions, we can improve conservation of urban green spaces and make future cities more liveable and resilient.
