## Undergraduate student

If you are interested in doing a field or laboratory internship with our team, please do not hesitate to contact me by [email](marie-helene.brice@montreal.ca) to learn more about current projects.  In your email, describe what motivates you to do an internship with us and tell me about your interests in ecology! Ideally, send me your CV and transcript as well.

For students with a good academic record, it is possible to apply for a [NSERC Undergraduate Research Award](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_fra.asp) for summer internships.

## Graduate student

Passionate students interested in our research are always welcome to join our team!

If you are interested in the (research themes)[../research] of our lab and would like to undertake a master's or doctoral project, I encourage you to [contact me](marie-helene.brice@montreal.ca) and include the following in your email :
- describe what kind of project you would like to work on;
- describe your research interests and experiences, and why you want to join our lab;
- attach your CV and your transcript.

To finance your graduate studies, it is possible to apply for a scholarship from
the [FRQNT](http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/bourses-et-subventions) and/or from
the
[NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/index_eng.asp).
There are also other scholarships [offered by the University of
Montreal](https://bourses.umontreal.ca/accueil/). Find out if you qualify! I
will be happy to help you complete your applications (but be aware that the
deadlines to apply are often well before admission to a program). Finally, the
lab's research funds can also finance students.
