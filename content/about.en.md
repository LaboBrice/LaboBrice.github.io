<!--I am a researcher at the Botanical Garden of Montréal and an associate-professor at Université de Montréal.

I am passionate about community ecology, functional ecology, landscape ecology, and conservation, with a special affection for plants.  -->


We seek to understand **how forests respond to global changes**, including climate warming, forest management and urbanization.

We study changes in forest communities over space and time by analyzing **taxonomic and functional biodiversity** as well as **forest dynamics** in order to understand their causes and consequences.

Our research is driven by a strong desire to **translate scientific findings into knowledge for conservation and management**.


**News**: I am now a researcher at the Montreal Botanical Garden! If you are
interested in field or laboratory based research related to the impact of
anthropogenic pressures on plant communities, I strongly encourage you to
contact me.
