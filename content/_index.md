I am currently a PhD candidate in ecology co-advised by Pierre Legendre and Marie-Josée Fortin. I am passionate about community ecology, functional ecology, landscape ecology, and conservation, with a special affection for plants. My research is focused on how plant individuals, populations, and communities respond to environmental changes, including climate warming, forest management, and urbanization. I apply different numerical methods to assess taxonomic and functional changes in plant communities in space and time, as well as to evaluate the causes of these changes. I am motivated by a strong desire to translate my research into knowledge for conservation and policy.



## Past research

For my [master thesis](https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/13639), at the Institut de recherche en biologie végétale, I investigated the impact of urbanization on riparian plant communities, combining a functional trait approach with landscape and historical ecology. Hydrological disturbances are an inherent feature of riparian ecosystems, which exert a strong and selective filter on plant communities. However, in cities, human-induced disturbances have long lasting consequences that can disrupt these fundamental ecological processes.

My [first chapter](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jvs.12425) aimed to unravel the role of natural and anthropogenic *filters*, as well as spatial processes, on community species and trait composition. We found that the effect of urbanization was principally indirect, through historical alteration of hydrological disturbances. This change in flooding regime allowed upland species to invade the formerly dynamic riparian habitat and led to a terrestrialization of riparian communities.

My [second chapter](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12565) focused on biotic homogenization. While urbanization is generally associated with biotic homogenization (decrease in ß diversity) of communities worldwide, its effect depends on the scale of the study and the local context. Here, we showed that urbanization instead led to taxonomic and functional differentiation of riparian communities, as well as to a loss in local species richness. We hypothesized that the biotic differentiation process was twofold: urbanization 1) creates new habitats by reducing flooding intensity (which is an important homogenizing filter on species and traits), and 2) triggers species losses by reducing habitat size.
