I am currently a PhD candidate in ecology co-advised by Pierre Legendre and Marie-Jos√©e Fortin. I am passionate about community ecology, functional ecology, landscape ecology, and conservation, with a special affection for plants. My research is focused on how plant individuals, populations, and communities respond to environmental changes, including climate warming, forest management, and urbanization. I apply different numerical methods to assess taxonomic and functional changes in plant communities in space and time, as well as to evaluate the causes of these changes. I am motivated by a strong desire to translate my research into knowledge for conservation and policy.



## Other involvements

I am also involved as a coordinator of [workshops](https://qcbs.ca/wiki/r) for programming in R and statistics for biodiversity science via the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science (QCBS), a large research network 120 researchers and ~700 graduate students from 12 universities. Last spring, we organized a [2-day symposium](https://qcbs.ca/wiki/r_symposium_2018) on biodiversity analysis for students, for which I developed a workshop on [geospatial analysis and mapping in R](https://mhbrice.github.io/Rspatial/Rspatial_script.html). I also collaborated on developing a series of blog posts about using [R for spatial data](https://insileco.github.io/2018/04/14/r-in-space---a-series/).
